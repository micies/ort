## Client (React)

The client-side of the application is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.


To install the required packages for the React client, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. To install the required packages, open a terminal and navigate to the client directory. Then, run the following command:

```npm install```
